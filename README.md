📝 Notes:
- JobType dropdowns and Role buttons are used to search jobs; keyword search was skipped due to similar data.
- Fonts are preloaded in `index.html` for faster rendering and reduced load time.
- Used `manualChunks` in `vite.config.js` to split React and Ant Design into separate bundles for better caching and performance.
- Figma design was 1440px so below screens are styled custom carefully, to match the original sample
